Greedy: Fast Deformable Registration for 2D and 3D Medical Images 
=================================================================
Greedy is a tool for fast medical image registration. It was developed by Paul Yushkevich at the `Penn Image Computing and Science Lab` at the University of Pennsylvania. The motivation for developing greedy was to have a really fast CPU-based deformable image registration tool that could be used in applications where many images have to be registered in parallel - like multi-atlas image segmentation.
